Subject: MY Software: NHS x Sunderland University Web App

Hello all, I hope you are doing well!

I'm reaching out to share this demo that the development team has put together to show our progress on the app, following up on our second meeting.
The demo video will be attached to this email.

If you would like any further resources, please follow up via email, and we will gladly send any details or sources over.
Any questions and/or comments are greatly appreciated.

Thank you very much for taking the time to read, watch, and respond to us.

All the best,
Cameron Haynes
Development Lead, MY Software
