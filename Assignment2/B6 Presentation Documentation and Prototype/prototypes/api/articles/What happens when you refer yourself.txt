What happens when you refer yourself

1. The service will contact you
Someone from the talking therapies service will get in touch to ask about the problems you're having.

2. You'll be recommended a therapy
The therapy you're offered will depend on the problems you're experiencing and how severe they are.

The service will also tell you how long you'll wait for your first therapy session.

There are different types of talking therapies available, including online therapy programmes, but they all involve working with a trained therapist.
