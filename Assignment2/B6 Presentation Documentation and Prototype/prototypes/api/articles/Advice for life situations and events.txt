Bullying at Work

How to identify if you're being bullied at work, how to stop it, and advice on getting support.

What is workplace bullying?
Bullying can involve arguments and rudeness, but it can also be more subtle.

Other forms of bullying include:

    • excluding and ignoring people and their contribution
    • overloading people with work
    • spreading malicious rumours
    • unfair treatment
    • picking on or regularly undermining someone
    • denying someone's training or promotion opportunities
    • using social media to humiliate, threaten or offend

Bullying can also happen in emails or on phone calls.

What effect does it have?
Bullying can make working life miserable. You can lose all faith in yourself, you can feel ill and depressed, and find it hard to motivate yourself to work.
Bullying is not always a case of someone picking on the weak. Sometimes a person's strengths in the workplace can make the bully feel threatened, and that triggers their behaviour.

What can I do?
Do not be ashamed to tell people what's going on. Bullying is serious, and you need to let people know what's happening so they can help you. By sharing your experiences you may discover that it's happening to other people, too.

Get advice
Speak to someone about how you might deal with the problem informally. This person could be:

    • an employee representative, such as a trade union official
    • someone in the firm's human resources department
    • your manager or supervisor

Some employers have specially trained staff to help with bullying and harassment problems. They're sometimes called "harassment advisers". If the bullying is affecting your health, visit a GP.

Stay calm
Recognise that criticism or personal remarks are not connected to your abilities. They reflect the bully's own weaknesses and are meant to intimidate and control you. Stay calm, and do not be tempted to explain your behaviour. Ask them to explain theirs.

Talk to the bully
The bullying may not be deliberate. If you can, talk to the person in question as they may not realise how their behaviour has affected you. Work out what to say beforehand. Describe what's been happening and why you object to it. Stay calm and be polite. If you do not want to talk to them yourself, ask someone else to do it for you.

Keep a diary
This is known as a contemporaneous record. It will be very useful if you decide to take action at a later stage. Try to talk calmly to the person who's bullying you and tell them that you find their behaviour unacceptable. Often, bullies retreat from people who stand up to them. If necessary, have a colleague with you when you do this.

Make a formal complaint
Making a formal complaint is the next step if you cannot solve the problem informally. To do this, you must follow your employer's grievance procedure.

What about legal action?
Sometimes the problem continues even after you've followed your employer's grievance procedure. If nothing is done to put things right, you can consider legal action, which may mean going to an employment tribunal. Get professional advice before taking this step.
Find out more about the law covering workplace bullying from GOV.UK: workplace bullying and harassment.

Where can I get help?
Let your manager or union or staff representative know of the problem, or seek advice elsewhere, such as:

    • Acas helpline
    • Citizens Advice: If you're being harassed or bullied at work
    • Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC)

Coping with Financial Worries

Feeling low or anxious is a normal response when you've lost your job, been made redundant, or you're struggling with debt.

You may be feeling, behaving or thinking in ways that are unfamiliar. But that does not necessarily mean you've got depression or an anxiety disorder.

How to survive financial stress

Stay active
Keep seeing your friends, keep your CV up to date, and try to keep paying the bills. If you have more time because you're not at work, do some form of exercise – physical activity can improve your mood if you're feeling low.

Get advice
If you're going into debt, get advice on how to prioritise your debts. When people feel anxious, they sometimes avoid talking to others. Some people can lose their confidence about driving or travelling. If this starts to happen, facing these situations will generally make them easier.

Do not drink too much alcohol
For some people with money worries, alcohol can become a problem. You may drink more than usual as a way of dealing with your emotions or just to fill in time. But alcohol will not help you deal with your problems and could add to your stress.

Get tips on how to cut down on alcohol

Do not give up your daily routine
Get up at your normal time and stick to your usual routine. If you lose your routine, it can affect your eating – you may stop cooking, miss breakfast because you're still in bed, or eat snacks instead of having proper meals.

Find out how to eat a balanced diet

More help for money problems

Finding a new job
GOV.UK also has a lot of information and advice if you're looking for work, including tips on writing a CV, planning your job hunt and applying for jobs online.

    • GOV.UK: finding a job

Coping with debt
Citizens Advice is a good place to get information about benefits, how to deal with debt, what you're entitled to if you're made redundant and who to speak to if you're at risk of losing your home:

    • Citizens Advice: work
    • Citizens Advice: benefits
    • Citizens Advice: help with debt

Other organisations offering helpful advice online include:

    • Money Helper, or call 0800 011 3797 Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm

    • StepChange Debt Charity, or call 0800 138 1111 Monday to Friday, 8am to 8pm and Saturday 9am to 2pm

Mental health and money
The charity Mind has a money and mental health section on its website, which includes advice on how to manage debt.

    • Mind: money and mental health

Mental Health & Money Advice offers information and advice for anyone struggling with money because of mental illness, or whose financial situation is affecting their mental health.

When you should get medical help
Most people who experience emotional distress find that after a few days or weeks they're able to tackle challenges, such as finding a new job.

See a GP if you're still feeling worried, anxious or low after a few weeks. If you think it will help, the GP can advise you about talking therapy services in your area.

You can also refer yourself directly to an NHS talking therapies service

Get help immediately if you cannot cope, if life is becoming very difficult or if you feel it is not worth living.

See a GP, call NHS 111 or contact a helpline such as Samaritans (call free on 116 123) for confidential, non-judgemental emotional support.

Mental Health Support if you're Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual or Trans (LGBTQ+)

Mental health problems such as depression or self-harm can affect any of us, but they're more common among people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans (LGBTQ+).

This may be linked to LGBTQ+ people's experience of discrimination, homophobia or transphobia, bullying, social isolation, or rejection because of their sexuality.

Other things, such as their age, religion, where they live, and their ethnicity can add extra complications to an already difficult situation.

How talking therapy can help
It might not be easy, but getting help with issues you're struggling to deal with on your own is one of the most important things you can do.

Talking with a therapist who's trained to work with LGBTQ+ people may help with issues such as:

    • difficulty accepting your sexual orientation
    • coping with other people's reactions to your sexuality
    • feeling your body does not reflect your true gender (gender dysphoria)
    • transitioning
    • low self-esteem
    • self-harm
    • suicidal thoughts
    • depression
    • coping with bullying and discrimination
    • anger, isolation or rejection from family, friends or your community
    • fear of violence

Read about different types of talking therapy and how they can help.

When to get help
Do not suffer in silence. You should get help as soon as you feel you need it. It's never too late to get help, no matter how big or small your problems might seem.

You could benefit from getting help if you:
    • feel tired, lack energy or have problems sleeping
    • feel anxious, agitate, irritable, low or depressed
    • shut yourself away from people
    • no longer want to do things you used to enjoy
    • use alcohol or drugs to help you cope with your feelings
    • harm yourself or have thoughts about self-harming
    • think about suicide

If you're struggling to cope right now, contact Samaritans:

    • call 116 123 (open 24 hours, every day)
    • email jo@samaritans.org

Samaritans offers a safe place for you to talk about whatever's on your mind, at any time.

How to Help Someone with Depression

Feeling down or depressed from time to time is normal. But if these feelings last 2 weeks or more, or start to affect everyday life, this can be a sign of depression.

Depression can develop slowly. Someone who's depressed does not always realise or acknowledge that they're not feeling or behaving as they usually do.

Often it's a partner, family member or carer who first realises that help is needed. They may encourage their friend or relative to see a GP or find some other source of support.

Signs that someone may be depressed
Depression has lots of possible symptoms.

You may notice that someone:

    • has lost interest in doing things they normally enjoy
    • seems to be feeling down or hopeless
    • has slower speech and movements or is more fidgety and restless than usual
    • feels tired or does not have much energy
    • is overeating or has lost their appetite
    • is sleeping more than usual or is not able to sleep
    • has trouble concentrating on everyday things, such as watching TV or reading the paper

See more symptoms of depression

Signs of depression in older people
Signs of depression in older people can include:

    • empty fridges and cupboards (which suggest a poor diet)
    • neglected appearance
    • poor hygiene
    • someone showing little joy in receiving visitors

Tips to help someone who seems down:

    • Let them know you care and are there to listen.
    • Accept them as they are, without judging them.
    • Gently encourage them to help themselves – for example, by staying physically active, eating a balanced diet and doing things they enjoy.
    • Get information about the services available to them, such as an NHS talking therapy service or depression support groups in their area.
    • Stay in touch with them by messaging, phoning or meeting for coffee. People who are depressed can become isolated and may find it difficult to leave their home.
    • Try to be patient.
    • Take care of yourself.

Read about how friends and family can help someone with depression on Mind.org.uk

When to get help urgently
If the person you're worried about expresses suicidal feelings, you or they should contact a GP or NHS 111.

You can also contact Samaritans on 116 123 for confidential 24-hour support.

Loneliness in Older People: how to help

There are lots of ways you can do your bit to help lonely or socially isolated older people in your community. The person you're helping will reap health benefits, and you'll find you will as well.

Volunteering for an organisation that supports older people is a key way of helping a lonely or socially isolated older person. But a simple friendly chat or phone call can make all the difference, too.

Evidence suggests giving your time in this way could be as valuable to you as the person you support.

It's likely to boost your self-esteem and sense of purpose. And helping others takes your mind off your own problems for a while.

Read our 5 steps to mental wellbeing and where volunteering fits in.

Read about the benefits of volunteering on the Royal Voluntary Service website


Start a conversation
It's not always easy to know who or how to help. A good start is simply to stop and talk to an older neighbour if you pass them on the street.

If you think an older person may have trouble hearing or has memory problems, make sure to speak clearly (but do not shout!).
Pause between sentences and questions to give them chance to digest the information. And allow a little extra time for them to respond – do not hurry them.

Offer practical help
Do you know an older person who lives alone, rarely leaves the house, has recently suffered a bereavement, is in poor health, disabled, has sight or hearing loss, or does not seem to have close family living nearby?

Ask them if they need any help with tasks such as shopping, posting letters, picking up prescriptions and medicines, or dog-walking.

Offer to accompany them or give them a lift to activities or doctors' and hospital appointments, the library, hairdressers or faith services.

Share your time
Volunteer for organisations that support older people. These often offer "befriending" schemes for isolated older people and rely on volunteers for one-to-one contact as a telephone "buddy", visitor or driver, or hosting social events for groups.

Your contribution could be as simple as a weekly telephone call to an isolated older person or extend to regular home visits for a chat and to help with shopping and so on, driving an older person to a social event, or even hosting coffee mornings for groups of older people.

You can find more information on volunteering to befriend and support older people from these organisations:

    • Age UK: volunteering to support your local Age UK
    • Independent Age: Volunteering with us
    • Royal Voluntary Service: Start your volunteering journey

Help with household tasks
Getting older can make it hard to tackle even simple jobs around the house.

Older people often really appreciate any offer of help with basic chores such as taking out the rubbish, changing light bulbs, fastening sash windows, clearing snow off the path, putting up pictures, and so on.

Share a meal
Older, isolated people often need a hand cooking for themselves, so why not take round an extra plate of hot home-cooked food, or a frozen portion they can heat up or microwave?

As well as being practical, it's a nice way to share your time with a neighbour.
Try to provide the meal in a container that you do not need back – it's hard work for both of you to keep track of serving bowls.

Find easy dinner ideas and recipes

Watch out for signs of winter illness
Older people are particularly vulnerable during the winter as cold weather increases their risk of illnesses, such as colds, coughs, flu, heart attacks, strokes, breathing problems and hypothermia (a dangerous fall in body temperature).

Check (ideally in autumn or early winter) if they have had a free flu vaccine and, if not, offer to make an appointment at the GP surgery.

Look out for signs of serious illness, such as drowsiness, slurred speech and the person not complaining of feeling cold even in a bitterly cold room.

Read about how to stay well in winter

If you're worried, ask if there's a relative or close friend you can phone, or call their doctor or NHS 111.

You could also contact your local council or ring the Age UK helpline on 0800 678 1602.

Find out how to spot and treat hypothermia

Useful resources
If you suspect your parents are lonely, read the When They Get Older website's loneliness guide.

How to Help Someone with an Eating Disorder

If a friend or relative has an eating disorder, such as anorexia, bulimia or binge eating disorder, you will probably want to do everything you can to help them recover.

You're already doing a great job by finding out more about eating disorders and how to try to support them – it shows you care and helps you understand how they might be feeling.

Getting professional help from a doctor, practice nurse, or a school or college nurse will give your friend or relative the best chance of getting better.

But this can be one of the most difficult steps for someone living with an eating disorder, so try to encourage them to get help or offer to go along with them.

You can support them in other ways, too:

    • Keep trying to include them – they may not want to go out or join in with activities but keep trying to talk to them and ask them along, just like before. Even if they do not join in, they would still like to be asked. It will make them feel valued as a person.
    • Try to build up their self-esteem – perhaps by telling them what a great person they are, and how much you appreciate having them in your life and that you're happy to support them.
    • Give your time, listen to them and try not to give advice or criticise – this can be tough when you do not agree with what they say about themselves and what they eat. Remember, you do not have to know all the answers. Just making sure they know you're there for them is what's important. This is especially true when it feels like your friend or relative is rejecting your friendship, help and support.

How are eating disorders treated?
Treatment will be different depending on the type of eating disorder your friend or relative has.

Talking therapies
It will usually involve some kind of talking therapy because help with eating and getting to a healthy weight, if needed, is usually not enough.

Your friend or relative will talk to a therapist about the emotional difficulties that led to their eating disorder, and they will learn healthier ways to cope with these feelings. Their treatment may also involve them working through a guided self-help programme.

Family therapy
Some people may also have family therapy, which is a type of group therapy. The person with the eating disorder is encouraged to work with family members to try to treat their eating disorder.

Family therapy usually involves parents and siblings but may sometimes include close friends or other family members.

Length of treatment
Treatment will take place over several months, so your friend or relative can get used to the changes slowly. The earlier they start, the better their chances of making a good recovery.

During their treatment, they will also have regular health checks to look after their physical health.

Find eating disorders services in your area

Read more about how eating disorders are treated

Will they have to go into hospital?
Most people with eating disorders will not have to stay in hospital. They are seen as outpatients, which means they visit the hospital for their appointments or any treatments.

Some people who have a more advanced or serious eating disorder might need to visit the hospital for longer appointments as a day patient or be admitted to hospital for more intensive support and treatment (known as inpatient care).

Should I visit them in hospital?
This depends on what your friend or relative wants, how you feel and what the treatment centre allows.

Let them know you're thinking of them and would like to visit. If this is not possible, you can always call, text or email them to let them know you're still there to support them.

Can people be forced to get help for eating disorders?
If your friend or relative has lost an extreme amount of weight, they may be in danger of starving themselves and developing serious complications. They may not be able to think clearly because of the lack of food and may have to be forced into life-saving treatment.

In these circumstances, their doctor may decide to admit them to hospital for specialist treatment. This can only be done after the doctor has consulted with colleagues and they all agree with the doctor's decision. This is called being sectioned and is done under the rules of the Mental Health Act.

The mental health charity Mind has more information about the Mental Health Act.

Will they be cured when they come home?
Your friend or relative will still need your support. Most people with an eating disorder do recover and learn to use more positive ways of coping.

But recovery from an eating disorder can be very difficult and take a long time. Your friend or relative may even relapse into old behaviours or have periods of living with their illness again during their recovery.

Part of them may want to get better, while the other part might be very scared about giving up the eating disorder. They might think: "I want to get better but I do not want to lose or put on any weight."

They will probably have good days and bad days. During times of stress, the eating difficulties may be more likely to return. Changing the way people with eating disorders think and feel is never easy, and it takes time.

Children and Bereavement

The following information could help if your child has lost or is about to lose someone, such as a family member or friend.

If your child is about to lose someone

If a child has a loved one, such as a friend or family member who's going to die, they can benefit from special support.

A child's stress level is often at its highest before bereavement because of fear and the unknown.

Pre-bereavement counselling gives a child a chance to think and talk about their feelings and share their worries.

The YoungMinds website has more information on counselling services for children and young people

Making a memory box
If you're a parent and you know you're going to die, you could make a memory box to give to your child or make one together.

A memory box contains things that remind you both of your time together. It can provide an important link between you and your child once you've gone.

Macmillan Cancer Support has information about making a memory box

If a child has lost someone

Talk about the person who has died
During bereavement, it can help a child to talk about the person who's died, whether it was a grandparent, parent, brother, sister or friend.

Direct, honest and open communication is more helpful than trying to protect your child by hiding the truth. If you exclude them from family ceremonies and services after someone has died it could make them feel excluded.

This can also help your child be open about their own feelings and avoid confusion about what has happened. It may be helpful to talk as a family, perhaps with your child, about how to include them in any events that celebrate or say goodbye to the person who has died.

It's important for them to have someone with whom they can talk about that person and share their emotions. This could be through photos, games, memory boxes or stories.

Over time, children may start to talk more about their loss at different times and in different ways. Young children may start talking about death or including it in their play, but this is normal and is a way for them to make sense of what has happened.

Further support for your child
There are also bereavement charities that offer helplines, email support, and online communities and message boards for children.

These include:

    • Child Bereavement UK –

Make a memory box
If the person who's died did not leave a memory box, you could make one with your child.

It can include:

    • gifts
    • shells collected on the beach
    • memories written on a card
    • anything that makes the child feel connected to that person

Don't forget to look after yourself
It's important to make sure you're also getting the support you need after a loss. This can also help you to better support your child.

Bereavement and Young People

Losing someone important to you is one of the hardest things to experience in life. If you're young, bereavement can be even more difficult. But support and advice are available to help you get through it.

Your teenage years can be a lot of fun, but they are also often an emotional time. If someone close to you dies, it can be incredibly hard. Your world may feel as though it has crashed down around you.

It can make you feel very alone, especially as a young person, because you might find that none of your friends have gone through anything similar and won't understand or know what to say.

Your emotions after a bereavement
Grieving is a natural part of recovering from a bereavement, and everyone's experience of grief is different. There are no rules about what we should feel, and for how long.

But many people find they feel a mixture of the following:

    • sadness
    • shock, particularly if the death was unexpected
    • relief, if the death followed a long period of illness
    • guilt and regret
    • anger
    • anxiety
    • despair and helplessness
    • depression

These feelings may be very intense, particularly in the early days and weeks. Time eventually helps these intense emotions subside, and there's no need to feel guilty about starting to feel better. It doesn't mean you're not respecting the person's memory or forgetting about them.

Your family may all react differently to a bereavement. You may find it difficult to see your parents or other adults grieving and not know what to say to them. You could try just letting them know you're there for them too while you get support yourself.

There are several things that can help you start to feel better. Looking after your health and talking to someone will help you get through this difficult time.

Finding support for bereavement
Talking about your grief is an important part of getting through a bereavement. Choosing who to talk to about your feelings is a very personal decision. Sometimes the most unlikely person can actually offer the most support.

If you've lost a family member, someone else in your family may also be good to open up to because they're likely to understand how you're feeling.

A close friend can be a good listener and a source of comfort and support, even if they haven't gone through this themselves.

There are lots of other sources of advice and support available, including:

    • websites and blogs – such as Hope Again, a website for young people going through a bereavement, where you can find information, read other people's experiences and add your own; and the Winston's Wish, Child Bereavement UK and Health for Teens websites, which also offer information and advice
    • helplines – such as the Cruse Bereavement helpline on 0808 808 1677
    • your GP – especially if you're concerned you're not coping, might be depressed, have trouble eating or sleeping, are thinking about hurting yourself, or you're not starting to feel better after a few months: they may suggest you have counselling
    • a teacher or tutor – you may be distracted or find it hard to concentrate at school or college for a while, so talking to a teacher you feel comfortable with can help them understand what you're going through and take a bit of pressure off you; special circumstances, such as bereavement, can sometimes be taken into account if you're having trouble with coursework or exams

Looking after yourself during a bereavement
During a time of grief you may not feel like looking after yourself, but it's important to help you cope with the extreme emotions that come with bereavement.

Some of the following quite simple things can make a big difference, such as:

    • eating – you may lose your appetite, but try to keep eating as normally as possible: your body needs food, even if you don't want it; ideally, go for healthy, well-balanced meals
    • sleeping – it can be hard to sleep when you're very upset, but there are some things that can help: read more about insomnia
    • socialising – seeing your friends and keeping up a normal social life may help take your mind off things and allow you to talk about how you're doing, if you want to; but don't feel guilty about not thinking about the person you've lost or having a good laugh with friends
    • exercising – regular exercise can make you feel good and help you sleep (but avoid doing vigorous exercise close to bedtime); it can also be a relief to focus on something physical when you're going through an emotional time
    • avoiding smoking, drinking and taking drugs – you may feel like smoking or drinking because you feel down, but your body has to work hard to deal with substances such as nicotine, alcohol or illegal drugs, especially when you're young, and they'll end up making you feel worse

Grief After Bereavement or Loss

Most people experience grief when they lose something or someone important to them. If these feelings are affecting your life, there are things you can try that may help.
Support is also available if you're finding it hard to cope with stress, anxiety or depression.

Symptoms of bereavement, grief and loss
Bereavement, grief and loss can cause many different symptoms and they affect people in different ways. There's no right or wrong way to feel.

As well as bereavement, there are other types of loss such as the end of a relationship or losing a job or home.

Some of the most common symptoms include:

    • shock and numbness – this is usually the first reaction to loss, and people often talk about "being in a daze"
    • overwhelming sadness, with lots of crying
    • tiredness or exhaustion
    • anger – towards the person you've lost or the reason for your loss
    • guilt – for example, guilt about feeling angry, about something you said or did not say, or not being able to stop your loved one dying

These feelings may not be there all the time and powerful feelings may appear unexpectedly.

It's not always easy to recognise when bereavement, grief or loss are the reason you're acting or feeling differently.

Stages of bereavement or grief
Some research suggests that there are 5 stages of bereavement or grief:

    • Denial – feelings of shock, disbelief, panic or confusion
    • Anger – feelings and behaviours such as blaming yourself or blaming others
    • Depression – feeling tired, hopeless or helpless – like you have lost perspective or feel isolated
    • Bargaining – feelings of guilt often raise questions like "If only I had done more"
    • Acceptance – this does not mean that you like the situation, it’s about accepting your loss and being ready to move forward

These are the most common stages of grief, but you may not experience them all. If you do go through these stages, they may not happen in a particular order and you may not move smoothly between them.

You might also experience other feelings as well as those mentioned.

Your grief might feel chaotic and out of control, but these feelings will eventually become less intense over time.

Prolonged grief disorder
For most people grief will become less intense over time. But for some people, grief lasts many months or years. This is known as prolonged grief disorder or complicated grief.

Symptoms of prolonged grief disorder include:

    • very difficult feelings such as sadness or guilt for over 6 months
    • spending a lot of time thinking about the person who's died
    • difficulty accepting the death
    • not being able to return to everyday activities
    • suicidal thoughts

You're more likely to have prolonged grief disorder if the death was traumatic or sudden and unexpected.

* Non-urgent advice *
See a GP if:

    • you have symptoms of prolonged grief disorder
