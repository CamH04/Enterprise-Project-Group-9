Anxiety & Depression
We all experience mental health difficulties at some points in our lives; in fact, 1 in 4 people in the UK will experience depression and/or anxiety each year (Mind, 2018). At Gateshead Talking Therapies we work with people presenting with mild to moderate anxiety and depression. Our aim is to help people better understand these difficulties and so begin to heal, recover and improve their wellbeing.



Is it common to have low mood and receive therapy?
Yes! 1 in 4 people will suffer from anxiety and depression each year.

What we CANNOT help with
Unfortunately, we may not be the most suitable service for some people.  We would recommend that you contact your GP or look at the Need Urgent Help or Other Sources of Support pages if you have one or more of the following problems:

    • If you are in crisis, such as at immediate risk of harming yourself or others
    • If you are experiencing psychotic symptoms (such as hearing or seeing things that aren’t there)
    • If you are already under the care of secondary care mental health services (such as the Community Treatment Team)
    • If you are having difficulties with drug or alcohol misuse
    • If you are dealing with a severe eating disorder
    • If you have a diagnosed personality disorder
    • If you have severe learning difficulties or severe autistic spectrum disorders
    • If you are in need of a medication review or diagnosis
    • If you are having difficulties with benefit claims or finances as the main problem you are dealing with at the moment, if this is the case please check out some other services which may be more helpful (such as Pathways and the Citizens Advice Bureau)

Severe mental health issues
If you have a history of serious mental health issues, it is possible that we are not best suited to help and may need to discuss this further with you and suggest you speak to your GP for further advice.

Drug and alcohol issues
If you have significant difficulties with alcohol or recreational drugs please call Gateshead Recovery Partnership/Change Grow Live (GRP/CGL) - formerly Evolve Gateshead - on 0191 594 7821 or visit the Evolve Gateshead website – our psychological therapies are only recommended when these problems have been adequately addressed.

Please be aware you should not refer yourself to Gateshead Talking Therapies if you are already receiving help or treatment from a mental health team, Counsellor or another psychological therapist.  You should instead contact that team / therapist.
