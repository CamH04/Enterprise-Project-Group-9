Jargon explained:
There are many words used in Mental Health services. This page explains some of the common ones that you may have come across.

Behavioural Action (BA)
A therapy to manage low mood to identify things that can help you feel better which involves thinking about things that are important to you and gradually increasing these activities or interests. It also involves using problem-solving skills to help you tackle problems that may affect your mood.

CBT: Cognitive Behavioural Therapy
CBT is a talking therapy where you are supported to identify what you are thinking, how you are feeling, what you notice in your body and what you do (thoughts, feelings, physical sensations, and behaviours) that happen in different situations. You will explore with the therapist ways to work together to try to change the thoughts and behaviours to help you feel better.

Low Intensity Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (LI-CBT)
A therapy to help you manage your difficulties by understanding the links with your thoughts, feelings, and behaviours. This therapy is used to help with a range of difficulties such as low mood, anxiety, phobias and self-esteem and usually you are offered up to six sessions.

Decider Skills
An intervention, typically delivered in a group setting, which teaches 12 skills to children and young people to help empower them to recognise their own thoughts, feeling and behaviours. The intervention aims to improve emotional regulation, reduce impulsive behaviour, and give young people skills to manage their own emotions.

Friends Resilience Programme
FRIENDS are a range of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) based programmes designed for groups of different ages of children to build social and emotional skills.

There are parent and carer sessions alongside the children’s group sessions to promote children’s resilience.

Each letter of FRIENDS helps the child and young person learn skills and techniques to manage their challenges:

F – feelings
R – relaxation
I – inner thoughts
E - explore solutions
N - now reward yourself
D - do not forget to practice
S - smile, stay calm and use your support networks).

High Intensity Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (HI-CBT)
A therapy to help you manage your difficulties by understanding the links with your thoughts, feelings, and behaviours. This therapy is used to help with a range of difficulties such as OCD, PTSD, Tics, Selective Mutism, depression, anxiety, phobias and usually you are offered up to ten sessions.

Living Life to The Full
This is an online self-help treatment for anxiety and low mood for children and young people, where you would receive therapist support to access the self-help materials.

OSI Grows
Online Support Intervention (OSI) is an online treatment offered to parents and carers of children aged 5-12 years with anxiety. The therapist meets the parents to discuss the Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) techniques that the parent can use at home to support their child.

PLCBT - Parent Led Cognitive Behavioural Therapy
PL-CBT aims to empower parents and carers to use strategies and techniques with their child to help them overcome difficulties with anxiety. This is suitable for parents and carers of children aged 5-12. This may be offered in a group or on an individual basis (on request).

General words used:

Assessment
An assessment is a collaborative process to understand the difficulties someone may be experiencing.

Capacity
Capacity or mental capacity is the ability to make decisions for yourself, including being able to make decisions about your care. Sometimes people may ‘lack capacity’ because of certain illnesses, injuries, learning disabilities or mental health problems.

Care Plan/Treatment Plan
A care plan or treatment plan is a map of actions that identifies your needs and strengths as an individual. This plan can help both you and your mental health professional identify what things may be difficult for you, so you can plan goals and treatments together that may be helpful.

Confidentiality
Meaning that any information you provide to mental health services must be kept private unless you consent to it being shared with other people. If there are concerns about your safety or the safety of someone else, confidentiality may be broken. Staff will always try to tell you if they need to share your information with anyone else.

Consent
Saying ‘yes’ to something that affects you. You may also hear ‘informed consent’ which means that you are fully informed and understand what you are saying yes to. If you are unable to consent because of your age or you do not fully understand, we may ask your family/carers to consent on your behalf.

Children's Services
Services provided by local councils to protect and support the needs and welfare of children.

Early Intervention
Early intervention is when a mental health condition is identified and treated at an early stage, which can reduce the long-term impact of the mental health difficulty.

Evidence-Based Treatments
This means when a certain treatment or approach (such as therapy) has been studied or researched and found to work well for certain conditions/difficulties.

Formulation
The therapist you see will help you to develop a shared understanding of you and your families’ presenting issues. The purpose of a formulation is so that everyone involved can understand the individual’s main difficulties, so they can plan on how to deal with or manage them.

Goals and Goal-Based Outcomes
Goals in therapy are about what the individual attending therapy wants to achieve. Goals should be discussed and agreed. Goal-Based Outcomes (GBO’s) are scales, usually 0-10 that helps you and the therapist understand what you would like to be able to achieve from the support, to think about where you are currently at and to help see any improvements made throughout therapy.

Intervention
Another word for support or treatment to help you get better.

Outcome Rating Scales (ORS)
We invite to complete a short questionnaire to share on a scale 0-10 how you are feeling in general about school, friends and family.

Safeguarding
Safeguarding refers to protecting your rights to live safely and to be free from abuse or neglect. Local authorities have a legal duty to protect people who are experiencing or at risk of experiencing abuse or neglect.

Session Rating Scale (SRS)
The SRS is a simple questionnaire asking 4 questions about how much that you felt understood, did you talk about what you wanted to, did the therapist listen to you, and overall, how you found the session- did you like it or do you want anything different next time. There are different versions for different ages: child, youth, and parent versions available.

Sign-posting
Sign-posting is when you are given information regarding a service or services which may be helpful for you.

Trauma
Trauma can happen when a person has gone through a very stressful, frightening, or distressing event. Traumatic events can happen at any age and have a lasting impact. Sometimes people are impacted quickly following a traumatic event, whereas others are not affected for a long time.

Risk Assessment
We will ask questions to identify if there are any risks that may impact you or others, which is regularly updated through your time within treatment.

Relapse Prevention
At the end of therapy support, you are invited to think about what things has helped you feel better, the therapist may suggest writing a staying well plan to help identify your strengths, think about support from others and how to access any future support.

Wellbeing
A state of being happy, healthy, and comfortable. This involves both physical and mental well-being, as they are equally as important.
