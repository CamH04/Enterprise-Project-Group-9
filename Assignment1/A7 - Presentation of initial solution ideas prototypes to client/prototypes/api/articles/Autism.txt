AUTISM

This guide can help if you or someone you care about is autistic or might be autistic.

What is autism?

Autistic people may act in a different way to other people
Autistic people may:

    • find it hard to communicate and interact with other people
    • find it hard to understand how other people think or feel
    • find things like bright lights or loud noises overwhelming, stressful or uncomfortable
    • get anxious or upset about unfamiliar situations and social events
    • take longer to understand information
    • do or think the same things over and over

If you think you or your child may be autistic, get advice about the signs of autism.

Autism is not an illness
Being autistic does not mean you have an illness or disease. It means your brain works in a different way from other people.

It's something you're born with. Signs of autism might be noticed when you're very young, or not until you're older.

If you're autistic, you're autistic your whole life.

Autism is not a medical condition with treatments or a "cure". But some people need support to help them with certain things.

Autistic people can live a full life
Being autistic does not have to stop you having a good life.

Like everyone, autistic people have things they're good at as well as things they struggle with.

Being autistic does not mean you can never make friends, have relationships or get a job. But you might need extra help with these things.

Autism is different for everyone
Autism is a spectrum. This means everybody with autism is different.

Some autistic people need little or no support. Others may need help from a parent or carer every day.

Some people use other names for autism
There are other names for autism used by some people, such as:

    • autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is the medical name for autism
    • Asperger's (or Asperger syndrome) is used by some people to describe autistic people with average or above average intelligence

Asperger Syndrome
People with Asperger's do not have the same learning disabilities that many people with autism have, but they might have a specific learning difficulty.

Some people call this "high-functioning" autism.

Doctors do not diagnose people with Asperger's anymore because it's now thought of as part of autism spectrum disorder. But if you were diagnosed with it before, this will stay as your diagnosis.

It's not clear what causes autism
Nobody knows what causes autism, or if it has a cause.

It can affect people in the same family. So it may sometimes be passed on to a child by their parents.

Autism is:

    • not caused by bad parenting
    • not caused by vaccines, such as the MMR vaccine
    • not linked to diet
    • not an infection you can spread to other people

Autistic people can have any level of intelligence
Some autistic people have average or above average intelligence.
Some autistic people have a learning disability. This means they may find it hard to look after themselves and need help with daily life.

Autistic people may have other conditions
Autistic people often have other conditions, such as:

    • attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
    • dyslexia
    • anxiety
    • depression
    • epilepsy

Signs of Autism

Find out what the main signs of autism are and if you should get advice.

Signs of autism - NHS
https://www.nhs.co.uk/conditions/autism/signs/


Signs of Autism in Children

Autism in young children
Signs of autism in young children include:

    • not responding to their name
    • avoiding eye contact
    • not smiling when you smile at them
    • getting very upset if they do not like a certain taste, smell or sound
    • repetitive movements, such as flapping their hands, flicking their fingers or rocking their body
    • not talking as much as other children
    • not doing as much pretend play
    • repeating the same phrases

Autism in older children
Signs of autism in older children include:

    • not seeming to understand what others are thinking or feeling
    • unusual speech, such as repeating phrases and talking ‘at’ others
    • liking a strict daily routine and getting very upset if it changes
    • having a very keen interest in certain subjects or activities
    • getting very upset if you ask them to do something
    • finding it hard to make friends or preferring to be on their own
    • taking things very literally – for example, they may not understand phrases like "break a leg"
    • finding it hard to say how they feel

Autism in girls and boys
Autism can sometimes be different in girls and boys.

Autistic girls may:

    • hide some signs of autism by copying how other children behave and play
    • withdraw in situations they find difficult
    • appear to cope better with social situations
    • show fewer signs of repetitive behaviours

This means autism can be harder to spot in girls.
The National Autistic Society has more information about autistic women and girls

Get Advice if you think your child might be autistic.

You could speak to:

    • a GP
    • a health visitor (for children under 5)
    • any other health professional your child sees, such as another doctor or therapist
    • special educational needs (SENCO) staff at your child's school

Getting diagnosed can help your child get any extra support they might need.

Signs of Autism in Adults

Main signs of autism
Common signs of autism in adults include:

    • finding it hard to understand what others are thinking or feeling
    • getting very anxious about social situations
    • finding it hard to make friends or preferring to be on your own
    • seeming blunt, rude or not interested in others without meaning to
    • finding it hard to say how you feel
    • taking things very literally – for example, you may not understand sarcasm or phrases like "break a leg"
    • having the same routine every day and getting very anxious if it changes

Other signs of autism
You may also have other signs, like:

    • not understanding social "rules", such as not talking over people
    • avoiding eye contact
    • getting too close to other people, or getting very upset if someone touches or gets too close to you
    • noticing small details, patterns, smells or sounds that others do not
    • having a very keen interest in certain subjects or activities
    • liking to plan things carefully before doing them

Autism in women
Autistic women may be more likely to:

    • have learned to hide signs of autism to 'fit in' - by copying people who do not have autism
    • be quieter and hide their feelings
    • appear to cope better with social situations
    • show fewer signs of repetitive behaviours

This means it can be harder to tell you're autistic if you're a woman.

The National Autistic Society have more information about autistic women and girls
:
See a GP if you may be autistic.

If you already see a health professional, such as another doctor or therapist, you could speak to them instead.

Getting diagnosed can help you get any extra support you might need.

Getting Diagnosed as Autistic

Find out how to get diagnosed as autistic and how a diagnosis can be helpful.

Getting diagnosed as autistic - NHS
https://www.nhs.co.uk/conditions/autism/getting-diagnosed/


How to get an autism assessment

1. Talk to someone for advice
If you think you or your child have signs of autism, the next step is to talk to someone about it.

You could speak to:

    • a GP
    • a health visitor (for children under 5)
    • any other health professional you or your child see, such as another doctor or therapist
    • special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO) staff at your child's school

Ask them about referring you or your child for an autism assessment.

An assessment is done by autism specialists. It's the only way to find out if you or your child are autistic.
Tips for when you speak to someone

Do:
    • write a list of the signs of autism you think you or your child have and bring it with you
    • ask people who know you or your child well (like friends, family or teachers) if they have noticed any possible signs you could put on your list
    • bring a pen and paper so you can take notes
    • bring your child or someone who knows you well with you, if you think it might help (you do not have to)

Do Not:
    • try not to talk too much about other things – autism should be the main thing you talk about

2. Have an autism assessment
An autism assessment is where a team of autism specialists check if you or your child are autistic.

An assessment team may:

    • ask about any problems you or your child are having
    • watch how you or your child interact with other people
    • speak to people who know you or your child well, such as family, friends, your GP or your child's teachers

At the end of the assessment, you'll be given a report saying if you or your child are autistic.

Find out what happens during an autism assessment

How a diagnosis can help

Parents and children
For parents and children, a diagnosis can help you:

    • understand your child's needs and how you can help your child
    • get advice about support for your child at school
    • get support for parents and carers of autistic people, such as financial benefits
    • understand that your child is not just being "naughty" or "difficult"

Adults
For adults, a diagnosis can help you:

    • understand why you might find some things harder than other people
    • explain to others why you see and feel the world in a different way
    • get support at college, university or work
    • get some financial benefits

If you find it hard to get an assessment
It's not always easy to get an autism assessment. Waiting times can also be very long.

If you're finding it hard to get an assessment, you could ask to speak to someone else, like another GP – this is called getting a second opinion.

It may also help to speak to other people who have been in a similar situation.

What Happens During an Autism Assessment

How to get an autism assessment
You need to be referred for an assessment by someone such as a GP or special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO) staff at your child's school.

You may have to wait a few months to get an appointment.

Find out how to get diagnosed



What you can do while you wait for an assessment
If you think you or your child need support at school, home or at work, you can start getting help before having an assessment.

You can:

    • ask a GP if the assessment team can suggest any support groups
    • ask a GP to refer your child for speech and language therapy
    • find a local support group using the National Autistic Society services directory
    • talk to teachers or special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO) staff at your child's school
    • speak to student support services at college or university
    • speak to your manager or human resources at work
    • ask your local council for a needs assessment to see what support they can recommend

What happens during an autism assessment
You or your child may have 1 or more appointments with a team of different professionals.

For children
The assessment team may:

    • ask you about your child's development, such as when they started talking
    • watch how you and your child interact, and how your child plays
    • read any reports sent by their GP, nursery or school
    • ask about their medical history and do a physical examination

A member of the team may also visit your child's school to watch them in class and at break time.

For adults
The assessment team may:

    • ask you to fill in a questionnaire about yourself and any problems you have
    • speak to someone who knew you as a child to find out about your childhood
    • read any reports from the GP about other health problems you may have

Getting the result
When the assessment is finished, you'll be given a report saying what the team found.
You may be given it by the team or get it in the post.

The report will say:

    • if you or your child are autistic – it might say something like you "meet the criteria for autism spectrum diagnosis"
    • what you or your child might need help with – such as social interaction, communication, behaviours or sensitivity to lights, colours and sounds
    • what you or your child are good at

Sometimes the report can be hard to understand as it can be full of terms used by healthcare professionals.

Ask the assessment team if you need any help.

You and your child should also be offered another appointment a few weeks or months later, to talk to someone from the assessment team about the report.

Autism is a lifelong condition, so the report will be used throughout childhood and into adulthood.

If you do not agree with the result
When you get the report, you may:

    • be told you or your child are not autistic
    • be asked to wait until your child is a bit older to be assessed again, as the signs of autism may not be clear
    • be given a diagnosis you do not agree with, such as a learning disability

Ask the assessment team why they have made the diagnosis they have.

The assessment team might arrange for a second opinion from a different team.

If you still do not agree, you can ask the GP to refer you to another team for a second opinion. Or you can pay for another assessment by a professional you choose who works outside the NHS (privately).

Remember that a second opinion may say the same thing.

Newly Diagnosed with Autism: Things to Help

Give yourself time
People react to a diagnosis of autism in different ways.

For some, it's a relief to find out why they or their child think, feel and act the way they do. For others, it can be a shock.

Try to give yourself time to come to terms with the diagnosis.

Remember:

    • help and support is available
    • even if things are hard now, they can get better
    • you or your child are still the same person as before
    • autism is not an illness or disease with treatments or a "cure"
    • autistic people have things they're good at as well as things they need help with

Find help and support services
You might feel alone when you or your child are first diagnosed.

But there are places you can get support.

You can get help from:

    • local support groups
    • national charities
    • other autistic people or parents on social media and forums
    • your school, college or workplace
    • your local council
    • your GP or the autism assessment team that diagnosed you

Find out about support you can get if you’re autistic

Listen to other people's stories
Some people find it helpful to find out about other people's stories of autism.

You could also search online for autism blogs, videos or books.

IMPORTANT: Remember, autism is different for everyone. What happened to other people might not be the same for you or your child.

Look out for other health problems
Autism is not an illness. But many autistic people also have other conditions.
These are not always checked for during an autism assessment.

See a GP if you have any concerns about your or your child's health. They can help you get any extra care you need.

Find out about other conditions that affect autistic people

Find out more about autism
It might help you and your family to find out more about autism.

There can be quite a lot to take in. You do not have to read everything.

Find information and advice about living as an autistic person or caring for an autistic child.

How to help your autistic child with day-to-day life

How to help your child communicate

Do:
    • use your child's name so they know you're speaking to them
    • keep language simple and clear
    • speak slowly and clearly
    • use simple gestures, eye contact and pictures or symbols to support what you're saying
    • allow extra time for your child to understand what you have said
    • ask your autism assessment team if you can get help from a speech and language therapist (SLT)
    • try ways to help them communicate, such as Signalong, Makaton or PECS
    • read tips from the National Autistic Society on communicating with your child


Do Not:
    • try not to ask your child lots of questions
    • try not to have a conversation in a noisy or crowded place
    • try not to say things that could have more than 1 meaning, such as “pull your socks up” or “break a leg”

Dealing with anxiety
Anxiety affects a lot of autistic children and adults. It can be caused by not being able to make sense of things going on around them, and feeling misunderstood or unaccepted by people who are not autistic.

Try to find out why your child’s feeling anxious.

It might be because of:

    • a change in routine – it might help to prepare your child for any change, such as a change of class at school
    • difficulty identifying, understanding or managing their feelings
    • a noisy or brightly coloured place – it might help to take your child to a calmer place, such as another room

If your child is often anxious, ask your GP about therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), which may help.

Search The National Autistic Society’s directory for counsellors experienced in helping people with autism and read more about managing anxiety from The National Autistic Society.

Helping with your child’s behaviour
Some autistic children have behaviours such as:

    • stimming – a kind of repetitive behaviour (such as flapping their hands or flicking their fingers)
    • meltdowns – a complete loss of control caused by being totally overwhelmed

If your child has these behaviours, read our advice about how to help your child’s behaviour.

Eating difficulties
Many children are “fussy eaters”.

Autistic children may:

    • only want to eat foods of a certain colour or texture
    • not eat enough or eat too much
    • eat things which are not food (called pica)
    • have problems with coughing or choking while eating
    • be constipated, so they feel full even when they have not eaten much food
It may help to keep a food diary, including what, where and when your child eats. This can help you notice any common issues your child has.

Speak to a GP or your autism team about any problems your child’s having with eating.

The National Autistic Society has more about how to help with eating problems

Problems sleeping
Many autistic children find it hard to get to sleep or wake up several times during the night.

This may be because of:

    • anxiety
    • sensitivity to the light from smartphones or tablets
    • problems with the sleep hormone melatonin
    • issues such as hyperactivity or a health condition that affects sleep

You can help your child by:

    • keeping a sleep diary of how your child sleeps to help you notice any common issues
    • following the same bedtime routine
    • making sure their bedroom is dark and quiet
    • letting them wear ear plugs if it helps
    • talking to a GP about how to manage health conditions that make sleep difficult, such as a food sensitivity or breathing problem

If these tips do not help, talk to your autism team about creating a sleep plan to help your child’s sleep behaviour.

If your child’s sleep does not get better, a GP might refer you to a paediatrician or child psychiatrist with experience of autism who can prescribe a medicine called melatonin to help your child sleep.

Staying healthy
It’s important that your child has regular check-ups with the:

    • dentist
    • optician
    • doctors treating any other conditions your child has

Children over 14 who also have a learning disability are entitled to an annual health check.
Do not be afraid to let staff know what they can do to make it easier to go for check-ups.
Find out more ways to stay healthy from the National Autistic Society

Friendships and socialising
Some autistic children find it hard to make friends.

There are some things you can do to help:

Do:
    • get ideas from other parents on autism forums and local support groups
    • ask your child’s school if they can help
    • ask your autism team how to help your child communicate and socialise
    • search the National Autism Society directory for local social groups that are autism-friendly
    • read more advice about making friends from the National Autistic Society

Do Not:
    • do not put pressure on your child – learning social skills takes time
    • do not force your child into social situations if they’re OK being on their own

How to help with your autistic child’s behaviour

Common types of behaviour in autistic children
Some autistic children may behave in ways that put a lot of strain on you and your family.

Some common autistic behaviours are:

    • stimming (short for 'self-stimulating behaviour'), a kind of repetitive behaviour
    • meltdowns, a complete loss of control over behaviour

You may hear health professionals call some behaviours "challenging".

Some autistic children can also be physically or verbally aggressive. Their behaviour can be harmful to themselves or other people.

But remember, all autistic children are different and not every day will be challenging or stressful.

Ambitious about Autism has more information about behaviours that challenge

Why these behaviours happen
Many autistic children use a set of behaviours to help them manage their emotions and make sense of their environment. Sometimes they're done for enjoyment.

Some things that can be linked to these behaviours include:

    • being over- or under-sensitive to things like bright lights, noises, touch or pain
    • anxiety, especially when routines suddenly change
    • not being able to make sense of what's going on around them
    • being unwell or in pain

These behaviours are not your or your child's fault.

Stimming
Stimming is a kind of repetitive behaviour.

Common stimming behaviours include:

    • rocking, jumping, spinning, head-banging
    • hand-flapping, finger-flicking, flicking rubber bands
    • repeating words, phrases or sounds
    • staring at lights or spinning objects

Stimming is usually harmless. It may look odd to others, but you should not try to stop it if it's not causing any harm to you or your child.

Ambitious about Autism has more on repetitive behaviours and stimming

Meltdowns
Meltdowns are a complete loss of control caused by being totally overwhelmed.

If your child has a meltdown, the most important thing is to try to stay calm and keep them safe.

If you're worried your child might hurt themselves or others, try to hold them to keep them safe.

It's not always possible to prevent meltdowns, but there are some things you can do that may help at an early stage.

These include:

    • letting your child wear headphones to listen to calming music
    • turning down or removing bright lights
    • distraction techniques, such as fiddle toys
    • planning ahead for any change in routine, such as a different route to school

It may help to keep a diary for a few weeks to see if you can spot any meltdown triggers that you can do something about.

The National Autistic Society has more on meltdowns


Speak to the autism care team or a GP if your child is: autism care team or a GP if your child is:
    • stimming all the time or having lots of meltdowns
    • being bullied at school because of their behaviour
    • aggressive, harming themselves or harming other people

If you're struggling to cope, your child may be referred for professional support.

Advice about school if your child is autistic

Choosing a school for your child
One of the main decisions you'll have to make is the type of school you want your child to go to.

You'll have to decide if you think your child should go to a:

    • mainstream school – a regular school where your child may get support from a special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO) if they need it
    • special school – a school for children with special educational needs
    • residential school – where children stay overnight
    • independent school – also called a section 41 school, which is not funded by the local council, so you might have to pay fees yourself

This can be a hard decision to make and there might not be lots of choice where you live.

Read more advice from:

    • National Autistic Society: deciding between a mainstream or special school
    • National Autistic Society: choosing a school in England

Getting support at a mainstream school
If your child can go to a mainstream school or nursery, you can help them get support if you think they need it.
1. Speak to staff at the nursery or school
Speaking to staff at their nursery or school is the best place to start.

You could speak to:

    • your child's teacher
    • the school's SENCO

Talk to them about your child's needs. For example, if they need help with communication, learning or social skills.

2. Ask what support your child can get
Ask the teacher or SENCO what support they can provide.

This may be things like:

    • extra teaching support for your child
    • different ways of teaching that are better for your child
    • separate lessons to help your child improve their skills

This may be enough for some autistic children. Other children may need extra support.

3. Get extra support if your child needs it
If your child needs extra support, they'll need an education, health and care (EHC) plan.

This is a document from your local council. It says what education and health needs your child has and what support they should get.

An EHC plan can either help:

    • the school apply for extra money so they can support your child
    • you apply for a place at a school that's better for your child

Your child does not need to have been diagnosed with autism to get extra support.

Find out more about EHC plans:

    • Ambitious about Autism: education, health and care plans
    • National Autistic Society: education, health and care plans in England

How to get extra support

    1. Ask your local council for an EHC assessment of your child's special education needs and disabilities (SEND). An EHC assessment can also be requested by your child's school, a health visitor, doctor, or relative.
    2. Have an assessment. The council will speak to you, the school and health professionals to work out what support your child needs.
    3. Read the draft plan. You can comment on the plan and add details, like the type of school you want your child to go to.
    4. Agree on the final plan.

The whole process can take a few months. Ask the school what support they can offer while it's happening.

Find your local council on GOV.UK

If you do not agree with the council's decision
The council may decide your child does not need an EHC assessment or plan. If this happens, it should tell you why.

If you do not agree with its decision, you have the right to appeal.

You'll be told how to do this when you hear from the council.

Getting a place at a special school
To get a place at a special school, your child will usually need an EHC plan.

As part of an EHC plan, you have the right to tell your local council what type of school you'd like your child to go to or name a particular school you prefer.

The council can only refuse this if there's a clear reason why the school is unsuitable.

Find out more about choosing a school with an EHC plan on the Independent Provider of Special Education Advice (IPSEA) website.

Where to get help and advice
Getting support for your child can be a long and complicated process.

You can get advice about it from:

    • Council for Disabled Children: find your local information, advice and support (IAS) service
    • National Autistic Society: education rights helpline

It may also help to speak to other parents of autistic children.

Find out where you can get autism support

Dealing with anxiety about school
Going to school can be an anxious time for any child. Some autistic children might find it very hard.

You can get advice about it from:

    • National Autistic Society: starting or switching school
    • National Autistic Society: difficulties at lunch and break times
    • National Autistic Society: homework
    • National Autistic Society: exams
    • National Autistic Society: dealing with bullying
    • National Autistic Society: exclusion from school in England

Help for families of autistic people

How autism can affect you and your family
Having an autistic child can put a lot of strain on you and your family.

You might need to spend a lot of time helping your child get the support they need. This can be very stressful and exhausting.

It may be hard to make time for the rest of your family and can affect your relationships with each other.

If you feel you need help, you can get support from lots of places.

Things that can help you and your family

Do:
    • ask friends and family if they can help with day-to-day things or just be there to talk to
    • get advice from other parents of autistic children or autistic adults – find out where to get support
    • listen to other parents' stories – you can search online for blogs, videos and books
    • ask your local council for a carer's assessment – you might be able to get extra support and financial benefits
    • think about doing a course for parents of autistic children – such as the EarlyBird course from the National Autistic Society

Do Not:
    • do not feel guilty for taking time for yourself when you can – even just going for a walk on your own can help give you a break

Talking to your child about autism
It's your choice when you want to tell your child about their autism.

Some parents do it straight away, while others wait until their child's a bit older. There's no right or wrong time.

When you tell your child, it may help to:

    • do it when they're feeling calm or relaxed
    • talk to them in a place where they feel comfortable, with no distractions
    • explain they do not have an illness, but they might need extra support to help them with some things
    • explain they might find some things harder than other people, and some things easier
    • bring them to a support group to meet other autistic children

The National Autistic Society has a guide for parents and carers with advice on how to tell your child about their diagnosis

Supporting your other children
Some children can find it hard if their brother or sister is autistic. If you have other children, there are things you can do to help them.

Do:
    • make time for them whenever you can – try to do some activities with just them
    • talk to them about what's going on and ask if they have any questions or worries
    • let them have time on their own or with their friends – for example, sleepovers at friends' houses
    • check the advice from Sibs, a charity for siblings of disabled children

Do Not:
    • do not be afraid to involve them in things like meetings with health professionals – it can help them understand what's going on

Changing from child to adult care if your child is autistic

What happens when your child turns 18
Where possible, your child will be asked to be more involved in the decisions about their care.
When your child turns 18:

    • the NHS will continue to care for their health, but they may see a different doctor or a care team for adults
    • they may have to pay for some of the care they used to get for free from the council
    • any support they need to help with their education will need to be provided by their college or university, if they go to one

If your child has an education, health and care plan (EHCP), this will usually continue until they're 25, unless they:

    • do not need support anymore
    • go to university
    • get a job

What you can do to help your child
It's a good idea to start thinking about your child's future when they're around 14.

You could:

    • speak to any doctors or care teams your child has about what happens when they turn 18
    • apply for a needs assessment from your council – this may help your child get some free care and support when they're an adult
    • apply for a carer's assessment if you care for your child – you may be able to get support and financial benefits
    • ask colleges or universities what support they can give your child, if they're planning to go to one

If you find it hard to get support from your council
If your council decides your child does not need the same support when they turn 18, you can complain if you disagree.

Check your local council's website for information about making a complaint.

You might also want to use an advocate (someone who helps speak up for you).

An advocate can:

    • help you understand the care process and challenge decisions you disagree with
    • go to meetings and write letters with you

Advice about medicines and medical appointments if you’re autistic

Useful tips for medicines
If you or your child take medicines, these tips may help.

Do:
    • ask if there are other treatments that might help – medicine might not always be the only option
    • ask about the possible side effects
    • tell your doctor if you think the medicine is not working or is causing side effects – some medicines can work differently in autistic people
    • ask for regular medicine reviews – a review is a check-up to see if the medicine you're taking is still right for you or your child and is not causing any problems
    • read advice about problems swallowing pills if this is a problem for you or your child

Do Not:
    • do not stop taking any medicines without speaking to a doctor first – some medicines can cause serious side effects if you stop taking them suddenly

Useful tips for medical appointments

Do:
    • ask for an appointment at the start or end of the day – the waiting room may be less busy and you may have to wait for less time
    • ask for a double appointment so you're not rushed
    • arrange a visit before your appointment – knowing what to expect when you go for your appointment may help you or your child feel less anxious
    • bring someone else with you on the day if it might help
    • ask at reception if there's a quiet place you can wait – if not, ask if you can wait outside or in the car and if someone can call or get you when they're ready

Do Not:
    • do not worry about letting staff know how they can make things easier – you have the right to ask for simple changes to be made that may help

Treatments that are not recommended for autism

Autism is where your brain develops differently to non-autistic people. It is not an illness and there is no cure.

If you're autistic, a GP or local autism team may suggest approaches that can help you to:

    • develop daily living skills
    • develop communication skills
    • manage other physical or mental health conditions, such as pain or anxiety
    • manage harmful behaviours

But there are also treatments and approaches that are not recommended because either:

    • they're fake
    • there's evidence that they're harmful
    • the research and evidence show no benefit to autistic people – or there's no good research into them

Treatments for autism that are fake or can be harmful
Some products or services, claiming to be cures or treatments for autism, are fake or can be harmful.

Examples of these include:

    • GcMAF – an unlicensed injection made from blood cells
    • bleaching – also called chlorine dioxide (CD) or Mineral Miracle Solution (MMS)
    • CEASE, which discourages vaccinations and recommends potentially dangerous levels of nutritional supplements
    • chelation – removing heavy metal toxins from the blood
    • secretin – a hormone found in the body
    • some vitamins, minerals and dietary supplements
    • raw camel's milk

Do not use any of these to treat autism.

How to spot fake treatments
There are some warning signs that may suggest a treatment is fake:

    • it claims to "cure" or help people "recover from" autism
    • it claims to cure lots of different conditions
    • it claims to work in most people and have quick results
    • personal stories are used to claim it works, rather than medical evidence
    • words like "miracle", "faith" and "trust" are used
    • it can be done by anyone without any training or qualifications
    • it costs a lot of money
    • it is not available on the NHS

How to report fake treatments
You can help stop people selling dangerous treatments by reporting anything you think might be fake.

For a product bought in England or Wales, call the Citizens Advice consumer helpline on 0808 223 1133 or contact the Citizens Advice consumer service using an online form.

For a medicine you think might be fake, visit the FakeMeds campaign on the GOV.UK website.

For an advert for a fake treatment in the media, on a website or on social media, make a complaint using the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) website.

Other treatments that are not recommended
The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) will only recommend something if there is good evidence that it benefits autistic people.

Research into the following approaches has not shown any benefit for autistic people and they are not recommended:

    • hyperbaric oxygen therapy – treatment with oxygen in a pressurised chamber
    • neurofeedback for speech and language problems – trying to change brain activity
    • auditory integration training for speech and language problems – therapy using music
    • omega-3 fatty acids – for sleep problems
    • exclusion diets – such as gluten-free or casein-free diets and ketogenic diets
    • oxytocin – a hormone

If you're considering a treatment that is not recommended by NICE, speak to a GP or local autism team to discuss the risks.
