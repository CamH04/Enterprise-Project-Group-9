The Emotional Wellbeing Team (Support for 4-18 year olds)

The Emotional Wellbeing Team (0191 2834560) is provided by South Tyneside NHS Foundation Trust and is a team of health professionals who work with children and young people aged between 4 and 18 years old experiencing difficulties, which may include:

    • Behavioural difficulties including low mood, anxiety and depression
    • Bereavement and loss
    • Bullying
    • Eating distress
    • Relationship difficulties

How can we help you?
We can offer for a child or young person:

    • Assessment – of your needs and difficulties so we can all get a clear understanding. This means we can make the right decisions about what happens next.
    • Individual sessions – where you meet with a member of our team to work together to look at the difficulties you are experiencing.
    • Group sessions – where you can meet other young people with similar difficulties to share thoughts and ideas and support.
    • Sessions with your family or people at school.

How can we help parents and guardians?
We can offer parents and guardians:

    • Support – We offer advice and guidance about your child and the difficulties they may be having. We can also help co-ordinate your child’s care if several other professionals are involved.
    • Group work – We have groups for parents and carers for support and practical advice.

We hope we can help you with these difficulties in the early stages. We will help your children to develop skills and build their resilience to enable a quick recovery reducing the risk of further distress.

We have excellent links with schools, GPs, health visitors, school nurses and other specialist services, so we can work with them and make sure your child’s treatment continues wherever they are.

Where we see you?
We will ask you to come and see us at our Grassbanks base, but we can be flexible if needed.


How to get in contact?
If you are a child or young person, then you can either ask a parent or guardian, teacher, GP or school nurse to make a referral to us.

Confidentiality
We will always keep what you tell us confidential, unless you tell us we can share it with your parents or teachers. However, there may be some information that we may have to share, if we feel you are in danger or could come to some harm.  We will always tell you if we want to share what you have told us.
