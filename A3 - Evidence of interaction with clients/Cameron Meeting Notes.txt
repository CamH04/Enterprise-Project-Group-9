Our idea has to fall into the guidelines of a good tool but not a substitute for mental health support. We must assist the NHS not take it over.
App has to be reliable / robust and effective
Must be interactible by the whole of Gateshead (people who can read / write, hard of hearing / deaf , those who can speak english)
Must be accessible by all over the age of 16

Suggestions:
Reminder system / daily check in
Reccomend articles based on keywords, personolised article reccomendation (in article link to external recources)
Lead to help in crisis
To make the app more self lead insted of linking with GP
